Over-determined systems\n * are solved by ignoring the point which have the smallest impact according\n * to their jacobian column norm. Only the rank of the matrix and some loop bounds\n * are changed to implement this.</p>\n *\n * <p>The resolution engine is a simple translation of the MINPACK <a\n * href=\"http://www.netlib.org/minpack/lmder.f\">lmder</a> routine with minor\n * changes. The changes include the over-determined resolution, the use of\n * inherited convergence checker and the Q.R. decomposition which has been\n * rewritten following the algorithm described in the\n * P. Lascaux and R. Theodor book <i>Analyse num&eacute;rique matricielle\n * appliqu&eacute;e &agrave; l'art de l'ing&eacute;nieur</i>, Masson 1986.</p>\n * <p>The authors of the original fortran version are:\n * <ul>\n * <li>Argonne National Laboratory.
